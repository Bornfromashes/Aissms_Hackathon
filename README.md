## Crypto Currency Exchange website (In Progress)
A website to exchange supporting multiple cryptocurrencies/ tokens on a single platform. Built entirely from scratch, it will be aimed at bringing the magic of blockchain technology. Bitcoin - the world's first cryptocurrency - was introduced in 2009 and since then over 1000 tradable tokens have come into existence. However, for a long time people missed out on the tremendous opportunity that the rest of the world had been enjoying. And this website has been built to to bridge that gap.
